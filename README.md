- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first recorded automobile
                accident occurred in 1891 in New York City?
                A gentleman driving an electric car collided
                with a bicyclist. Thankfully, no one was
                seriously injured! 🚗🚴‍♂️
                🚗 Carl Benz applied for a patent for his
                “vehicle powered by a gas engine”
                on January 29, 1886. This patent application
                is considered the birth certificate of the automobile! 🎉
